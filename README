so be sure to code the cleanest, simplest program possible. 
Otherwise, you’ll probably have 2 start from scratch for your 21sh
and that would be a real shame.

malloc, free
access
open, close, read, write
opendir, readdir, closedir
getcwd, chdir
stat, lstat, fstat

fork, execve
wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4 
signal, kill
exit

TODO: 
-echo;
-cd;
-setenv;
-unsetenv;
-env;
-exit.
